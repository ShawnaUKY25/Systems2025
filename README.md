## University of Kentucky Fight Song
> On, on U of K. We are right for the fight today!
Hold that ball and hit that line. Every Wildcat star will shine.
We’ll fight, fight, fight for the Blue and White, as we roll to that goal, varsity.
And we’ll kick, pass and run ‘til the battle is won, and we’ll bring home the victory!
